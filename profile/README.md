**SolverForge** is a community-driven initiative to continue and expand upon the work started by [Timefold](https://www.timefold.ai)'s now-discontinued Python solver.

Our first objective is to provide a first-class, open-source AI constraint solver for Python that is able to provide optimal solutions to problems such as Vehicle Routing,
Employee Rostering, Maintenance Scheduling and more.

**Why SolverForge?** -> Continuity & Innovation
We’re picking up where Timefold left off, ensuring no loss in momentum for Python users: our legacy solver is a 1:1 fork of version 1.24.0b0 of the original Python solver. 
Therefore, running `pip install solverforge-legacy` and updating your imports is all you need to get on board and continue receiving support.
